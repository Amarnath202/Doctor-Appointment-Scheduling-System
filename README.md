This doctor's appointment system will organize the schedules of each patient's appointment, which will be submitted as a request to the doctor they have selected. The system comprises three key roles: administrator, doctor, and patient. The system admin will populate the list of the doctors with their specialties and along with the doctor's details and system credentials. The patients can browse the doctor's appointment system website to find a doctor that has the specialty of their needs.

After that, the doctors can view all their appointments and the appointment request of the patients for their availability.
